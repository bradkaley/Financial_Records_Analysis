# Financial Records Analysis

This repository contains scripts to perform two analyses using Python: 

1. PyBank: The goal was to analyze monthly profit & loss (P&L) data for a company to determine the total P&L over the period, average monthly change in P&L, and the greatest increase and decrease in monthly profits.

2. PyRamen: The goal was to use menu information and transaction data (i.e., sales) from a restaurant to calculate the quantity sold, revenue, cost of goods sold (cogs), and profit for each menu item for the period.

Both analyses output a .txt file with the results of the analysis for viewing.
